The general idea of "GADA"which means gift is to create a web application where some users can post a specific issues related to funding and other users can lend a helping hand. currently In our country this is done through ethio telecom using text messages like 8100. And our plan is to modernize this way by developing a mobile application where every thing is direct and easy.

For this project we will have 3 type of users;

Administrators
      -that have full previlages to all CRUD cpabilities towards all feature like adding/removing clients, donations and posts
      -will have managing page which includes authentication and authorization
clients
      -have privillages to CRUD posts
      -login into their accounts
      -have their own profiles and can manage it
users
      -login(sign up if first time)
      -can only see the posts and provide donations
      -will have their own profile pages and can manage it

BUSINESS FEATURES 
1. Posts: specific issues that needs funding
2. Donations: where a user can provide funds


Authentication and Authorization Features

-The admin will be authorized for all CRUD capabilities of both features
-The client will have authorization for CRUD capabilities of their own posts
-Users will only be authorized to creating,Reading donations
-Both clients and users will be able to create, update, read and delete their own profiles

-Authentication will be added so that that no one will be able to access what he/she isn't authorized to do so
-authentication will also be added when logging in.
